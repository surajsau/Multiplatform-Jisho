Kotlin Multiplatform Japanese Dictionary App.

ðŸš§ This is still a Work in Progress. Wishlist of features are listed up in the [Projects](https://github.com/users/surajsau/projects/1).

## Mutliplatform
This project has the [Kotlin Native memory model](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/0b871d7534a9c8e90fb9ad61cd5345716448d08c/kotlin-native/NEW_MM.md) enabled (check `gradle.properties`)

```.properties

kotlin.native.binary.memoryModel=experimental
```

### Architecture
Everything except from the UI layer (i.e., the domain and data layers) have been implemented in the `:shared` module.

## Libraries used
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) `1.6.10`
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
- [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin)
- [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight)
- [KMP-NativeCoroutines](https://github.com/rickclephas/KMP-NativeCoroutines) `0.11.4-new-mm`
- [Firebase Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) (for storing the preloaded database file)
- [neumorphic](https://github.com/costachung/neumorphic) (Neumorphism in SwiftUI)

## References
- [compose-neumorphism](https://github.com/sridhar-sp/compose-neumorphism) Used as a reference for custom implementation of Neumorphism in Jetpack Compose
- [hackingswift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) for anything SwiftUI
- [droidkaigi 2021 App](https://github.com/DroidKaigi/conference-app-2021) for the Unidirectional ViewModel implementation
- [yamagoya/jconj](https://github.com/yamagoya/jconj) for the verb adjective conjugation mapping

## Branches
- `shared` : Any changes done outside the `iosApp` and `androidApp` modules
- `android` : Changes made to the `androidApp` module
- `ios` : Changes made to the `iosApp` module

## Data Source
Preloaded `.db` file has been generated using the [`create_database.py`](script/create_database.py) script. The following data sources have been parsed

#### [JMDict](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project)
The main data source for the dictionary and contains roughly over 170,000 entries with informations like meaning, kana-reading, sentence samples, particles of speeches etc.

#### [Kanjidic2](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project)
This includes Kanji related informations like reading, stroke count etc.

#### [Tanaka Corpus](https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads)
This is a database of sentences mapped in various languages (primarily JP-EN). Multiple lanugages could have been chosen but instead went with the English Japanese Sentence pairs dataset.

#### [JLPT Resources by Jonathan Walters](http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/)
This contains a roughly comprehensive list of vocabulary divided on the basis of JLPT level.
